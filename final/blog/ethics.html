<!--AI Art is taking the internet by storm and this is a topic that I'm very passionate about. 
    I hope that if you read this in its entirety that you find it rewarding and know a little bit more before making decisions about paying for something generated by an AI generater. (:
    Thanks for coming to my TedTalk. -->

                        </figure>
                        <p>Often when a trend makes its way around sites like TikTok, Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook, there are a significant number of users who do not fully think about the impact of their actions and whether they pose a potential danger, threat, or concern for themselves and others. These concerns are often warned about in new segments and sometimes severe enough that the FDA issued a statement about the danngers of consuming <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N1rmMLCnBtc">NyQuil Chicken</a>.</p>
                        <p>When it comes to art trends, they are often regarded as more wholesome like showing your art process through a video and uploaded online. Occasionally, there will be a wave of a new batch of filters that get uploaded on TikTok, Instagram, and Snapchat. For December, you could say “filters” have now elevated into the AI Art space.</p>
                        <p>Within the last month, social media feeds have been flooded with batch posts of multifaceted stylized “magic avatars” created using the Lensa app. Lensa is the latest photo editing app to take the internet by storm because its latest feature allows users to create “magic avatars” from a series of selfies they upload themselves. </p>
                        <h3>How does this work?</h3> 
                        <p>Lensa utilizes open-source AI known as <a href="https://stability.ai">Stable Diffusion</a> to transform your photos into stylized avatars giving the illusion that they were created by digital artists. While this trend seems harmless to a lot of people, there are ethical concerns that are coming to light not only from artist communities online, but also from a data management about the use of personal data. The backlash with this trend encompasses concerns with the AI generator powering it called Stable Diffusion and Lensa's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.</p>
                        <p>Stable Diffusion's dataset derives from LAION-5B and encompases around 2 billion captioned images from the internet. Many of these images are watermarked and copyrighted works, as well as a number of image coming from sources like Pinterest, Flickr, DeviantArt, ArtStation, and Shutterstock. </p>
                            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I was confused about this too. Y’all, the AI isn’t compiling images to make unique art. It’s stealing art, removing the details, &amp; putting ur face over it. Those are someone’s pre-existing drawings. That AI is an art theft machine. <a href="https://t.co/ZsslOoLxNr">https://t.co/ZsslOoLxNr</a></p>&mdash; Honey Ma (@TheHoneyMa) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheHoneyMa/status/1599087967309828096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
                            <p>Despite it absorbing all of these images despite their copyrights, it is legal for LAION-5B to do this because they are a nonprofit research entity and Stable Diffusion is free for all and open source.</p>
                            <p>According to Stability's FAQ page, the AI generator was built in accordance with German law. The concern among artists is the inability to opt-out to include their work from the crawler. This is also confirmed on Stability AI's website:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            There is no opt-in or opt-out of the LAION 5b model data. It is intended to be a general representation of the language-image connection of the internet.

                        </blockquote>
                        <h3>Oversexualization and White Washing</h3>
                        <p>Although there is currently no way to opt-in or out, the company states that they are looking into being able to provide this option in the future. In addition to the concerns about artist theft, additional concerns include personal medical photos being in the LAION 5b database, Lensa's Terms of Service, and the risk of the app producing hyperrealistic NSFW images from childhood images and <a href="https://twitter.com/_trashbaby13/status/1600566086793043968?s=20&t=N16FvSSqfQyBtVl_zIBVbQ">fully clothed images</a> the user supplied through the app.</p>
                        <p>Olivia Snow featured her story on <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/lensa-artificial-intelligence-csem/">Wired</a> and said that Lensa was able to generate nude photos of herself using photos from her childhood. In this same article, she also reported that women of color told her that the app generated images of them that whitened their skin and "angelicized" their features. Others reported that the app does not process their features correctly and fat people noted that the images the app produced made them look thin.</p>
                        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Me (visibly fat at a selfie angle) vs some of the shit Lensa has produced <a href="https://t.co/PWKodWL48S">pic.twitter.com/PWKodWL48S</a></p>&mdash; Yasemin Anders · (She/They) (@Yasemin_Writes) <a href="https://twitter.com/Yasemin_Writes/status/1599439019388960768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
                        <p>Users have reported that some of the photos they've gotten back after processing have included them being naked. This poses risks for AI generated NSFW images being used as blackmail, posted online as a form of revenge porn, and harassment. Since this issue has come to light, Prisma Lab's CEO Andrey Usoltsev issued a statement to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/06/prisma-ai-regulation/">TechCrunch</a> on Tuesday, December 6, 2022</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            “To enhance the work of Lensa, we are in the process of building the NSFW filter. It will effectively blur any images detected as such. It will remain at the user’s sole discretion if they wish to open or save such imagery.”

                        </blockquote>
                        <h3>Addressing Content and Privacy Concers</h3>
                        <p>Within the Terms of Use, Section 6 covers prohibited conduct and content stating that the user agrees to not use Lensa in ways that would cause harm to others including:
                           <blockquote> 
                            <ul>
                                <li>Exploiting, harming, or attempting ot exploit or harm minors in any way;</li>
                                <li>Generate or disseminate verifiably false information or content with the purpose of harming others;</li>
                                <li>Generate or disseminate personal identifiable information that can be used ot harm an individual;</li>
                                <li>Defame, disparage, or otherwise harass others;</li>
                            </ul>
                            <cite>- <a href="https://lensa-ai.com/terms">Lensa Terms of Use</a></cite>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>However, even with these policies being part of the user agreement, the app does not stop the user from uploading explicit media. If the AI is fed explicit material, it will continue to be trained on the type of content and yield NSFW results.</p>
                        <p>In addition to concerns over explicit material, there also data concerns that have been brought to light within their same Terms of Use. These terms state that the users "retain all rights in and to your user content" and that by using the app, this also grants Lensa "perpetual, revocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, fully-paid, transferable, sublicensable lisense to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, translate, create derivative works" of these photos a user uploads.</p>
                            <p>Essentally, what this means is that the company then owns the rights to any digital artwork made from using this tool in the app. Lensa provides can be used by Lensa With technology moving a lot faster than laws can be passed, it puts the use of this technology into a legal grey area.
